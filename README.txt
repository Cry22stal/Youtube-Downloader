The Program is self explanatory, still:

2. Paste in text field inside the program

3. Select Option (Audio / Video)

4. Select Quality (by option number 0/1/2)

5. Download will start
(Sometimes, the program might get stuck/stops responding,
just wait for a few seconds, it'll respond eventually)

Note: Browse Downloaded Files will open the downloads folder.
Note: Downloads folder will appear in the same directory where the program is saved.


IMPORTANT: Please read the DISCLAIMER.txt provided with the package before using the program.
